											<h3 class="major">Scalable and redundant Wordpress Application hosted on AWS<br>
											Using EC2, ALB, EFS, RDS, Cloudwatch, and Auto Scaling</h3>
											<p>  <br>
											In this project, I succesfully orchestrated the deployment of a scalable WordPress application on AWS, utilizing an Application Load Balancer for efficient traffic distribution.
												Automation through an EC2 Auto Scaling Group with a customized launch template streamlined the process.
												Dynamic scaling policies based on CPU utilization thresholds were implemented for optimal resource management.
												Media access across instances was facilitated through an integrated Elastic File System (EFS).
												The project also involved migrating a local EC2 MariaDB database to an RDS instance for enhanced scalability and reliability.

											<h3 class="major">Serverless Application hosted on AWS <br> Using S3, API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, and SES</h3>
											<p><br>
											
											I designed and implemented a Serverless Email Reminder system, ensuring a seamless flow of communication.
											IAM Roles were meticulously set up, granting appropriate permissions for the application services. 
												The frontend static website, containing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, was hosted on an S3 bucket.
												JavaScript facilitated user input and communication with an API Endpoint.
												A REST API Endpoint was deployed to invoke the API_Lambda for backend compute. 
												I configured a State Machine to utilize SES via Email_Lambda, incorporating user inputs.
												The State Machine then invoked Email_Lambda, which interfaced with SES to send email reminders, effectively utilizing the input payload from the frontend JavaScript.

											<h3 class="major"> Website hosted on AWS<br>
												Using S3, Route 53, CloudFront, ACM, Lambda, DynamoDB, CodePipeline, Github  </h3>
											<p>  <br>
											I developed a personal website using AWS services for optimal performance and functionality. Starting with the creation of an S3 bucket, I deployed a CloudFront CDN distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin access identity (OAI).
												The domain was registered with Route 53, and an A record was configured to direct traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
												Security was enhanced with an SSL certificate obtained from ACM to ensure a secure HTTPS connection.
												For visitor tracking, a DynamoDB table was set up to store website view counts.
												A Lambda function, equipped with CORS, was created to increment the DynamoDB view count table based on website viewership.
												To streamline updates, a connection to a GitHub repository was established using CodePipeline, automating the deployment process.
												This project reflects my proficiency in leveraging AWS services to create a secure, dynamic, and automated personal website.

											<h3 class="major"> Automating Jenkins Application on Linux with Terraform</h3>
											<p> <br>
												I automated the deployment of a Jenkins application on Amazon EC2 using Terraform, streamlining the infrastructure provisioning process.
												The Terraform script orchestrated the creation of an EC2 instance, specifying the required configuration details such as instance type, security groups, and key pair.
												Additionally, I automated the installation and configuration of Jenkins on the EC2 instance by utilizing remote execution scripts. The setup also included defining necessary networking components like VPC and subnets to ensure proper connectivity.
												The Terraform automation expedites the deployment of Jenkins and also ensures consistency and reproducibility, simplifying the management of the Jenkins infrastructure on EC2.</p>
